How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

While working on a program, user stories are essential for smooth working progress. Implementation of user stories into a program is often done while the development of the program is ongoing. User stories lack details that are usually required by the testers and developers; therefore, when the implementation of user stories comes, pieces are added to prevent reworks and keep each stakeholder on track. Working with user stories in program development is done by strictly following the three critical aspects of user stories, referred to as 3Cs, developed by Ron Jeffries, including card, conversation, and confirmation. 

After the user stories have been followed by the 3C’s, the developer then grabs one of the stated user stories then subdivides the “I need to” part into smaller parts to be tasked on. The subdivided domains are held one after another, and tests are performed to tackle the task picked. Then the task can be implemented by using the Test-Driven Development approach (TDD). This process is repeated on all the remaining user stories during the program development process to ensure practical completion. Creating user stories enables the developers to subdivide the user stories into smaller tasks effectively.

One of the essential agile frameworks that are used in the development of software is Scrum. This agile approach concentrates on delivering sprints and meeting the planning, commitment, and daily stand-up meetings. Therefore, when developing software, the scrum framework can be used to create the software effectively. Another agile process includes Kanban. Being a good team member during software development work collaborates with other members and accepts opinions relevant to the software development. They also exercise emotional intelligence and passion in their work.
